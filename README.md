# RaceCalendar
Organize your races this year on this convenient calendar application!

# Project description
Many avid athletes enjoy registering for multiple races a year. Keeping track of all of these can be cumbersome and they may get lost in the abyss of google calendar commitments. This app is a one stop place for athletes to check to see what races they have coming up. In addition, they can add new races and plan for sufficient recovery time in between their activites. 

# Team
I'm looking for one or two others to join the implementation team. 

# Implementation
We plan to implement the MVP using an SQL, then migrate to NoSQL.

# SQL
Not sure which relational database to use. Suggestions welcome!

# No-SQL
We are leaning towards using a key-value database once the nonprofit becomes so popular that it outgrows SQL databases.

# BOLTS

# Business
At no charge, anyone may use the service to create a profile, save and manage races, and view their yearly calendar. 
We plan to quickly implement a "minimum viable product" prototype, and then seek sponsors from race companies.

# Operation
The founders will operate the application until it becomes more successful, at which time we will hire a staff, led by a Chief Operating Officer (COO) to ensure value to our customers.

# Legal
The business will be a Utah LLC.

# Technical
Our priorities will be:

1. Choose and reserve a domain name to house the website.
2. Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
3. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
4. Implement the MVP

# Social
We will gain customers initially through advertising on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, and SnapChat.
